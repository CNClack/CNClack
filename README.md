- 👋 Hi, I’m @CNClack
- 👀 I’m interested in backend, data science and machine learning tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go, Julia & Data Science / Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. If I like it, I'll work on it.
- 📫 How to reach me: At this time, you don't. I'm still setting things up around here and I honestly don't want anyone reaching out to me at this time.
